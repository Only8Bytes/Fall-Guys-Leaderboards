http://fallguysleaderboards.com/ is a leaderboard for Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout that I had developed by myself in Spring 2021. The website acts as a leaderboard for all player stats that can be tracked through the Fall Guys Stats Tracker.

All minigames have associated leaderboards organized by either score or race times for individual players. All players have social media links(optional) as well as information about their total play history. Miscellaneous categories are also added with information gathered from the database files of the tracker.
