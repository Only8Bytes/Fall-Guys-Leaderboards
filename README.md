http://fallguysleaderboards.com/ is a leaderboard for Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout that I had developed by myself in Spring 2021. The website acts as a leaderboard for all player stats that can be tracked through the Fall Guys Stats Tracker.

All minigames have associated leaderboards organized by either score or race times for individual players. All players have social media links(optional) as well as information about their total play history. Miscellaneous categories are also added with information gathered from the database files of the tracker.

As of Summer 2021 the leaderboards have not been shared publicly which explains why there are very few entries. This is merely a proof of concept for now, but would be capable of handling public information if I chose to share it, which I have not yet.
